      'Slumber is a social sleep-tracking app for iOS and Android. You log nights from Apple Health, Health Connect, Google Health (optional), or manually, add context (notes, dreams, photos, tags), and share with friends you mutually approve. You can also join sleep clubs, compare with friends, appear on optional leaderboards, and race in challenges.',
      'An optional web companion lets signed-in users browse their feed, profile, stats, Compare, Leaderboards, Clubs, Friends, and challenges in a browser and leave kudos and comments. Sleep logging, health sync, contacts matching, auto-publish, and most account and privacy settings stay in the mobile app.',

      'Account information: email address (for email one-time-code / magic-link sign-in), username, profile photo, sleep goal, and optional profile and privacy settings. You can also sign in with Google. On iOS you can Sign in with Apple.',
      'Sleep data you create: sleep duration, bed and wake times, sleep stages (when available from a wearable), hypnogram samples, titles, optional typed location labels (not GPS), vibes, tags, morning notes, dream journal entries, optional dream mood, and photos you attach to posts. Wearable source names (for example Apple Watch or Whoop) may be stored on a post when the health platform provides them. Slumber does not connect to wearable vendor accounts directly, except optional Google Health.',
      'Manual sleep logs: when you log a night without wearable data, we store the times and duration you enter. Manual logs appear in your social feed but are excluded from competitive stats, personal records, leaderboards, club analytics, and challenge scoring.',
      'Offline drafts (on device): if you save a sleep post while offline, the draft (including any photos you attach) is stored temporarily in the app’s on-device storage until it syncs to our servers when you reconnect. Offline drafts are not visible to friends until sync succeeds.',
      'Apple Health data (with your permission): sleep duration and stage data read via HealthKit to populate wearable sleep logs. On iOS, optional background delivery can refresh last-night sleep so auto-publish can run without opening the app. Slumber only reads Health data you authorize; we do not write to HealthKit on your behalf.',
      'Health Connect data (Android, with your permission): sleep duration and stage data read via Health Connect to populate wearable sleep logs. Slumber only reads Health Connect data you authorize; we do not write sleep data back to Health Connect on your behalf.',
      'Google Health data (optional, with your permission): if you connect Google Health in Settings, we read sleep duration and stage data from your Google Health account via Google\'s API using the restricted scope googlehealth.sleep.readonly. OAuth refresh tokens are stored on our servers (never on your device) so we can fetch sleep on your behalf. Slumber only reads sleep data you authorize; we do not write sleep data to Google Health. See "Data protection" below for how we safeguard this data.',
      'Photos: you can pick images from your photo library for your avatar and sleep posts (stored in our file storage). Share cards can be saved back to your photo library if you choose. Slumber does not use the camera.',
      'Social activity: friend relationships, friend-of-friend suggestions, comments, comment likes, kudos, sleep clubs, club membership and invites, sleep challenges, challenge progress, sleep buddy tags, notifications, invite links, and @mentions in notes, dreams, and comments.',
      'Contact hashes (optional, with your permission): if you use Find from contacts, we receive one-way SHA-256 hashes of emails and phone numbers from your address book (and hashes of your account email, and of a phone on your auth record if one exists). We never upload your raw address book. Slumber does not use phone numbers for sign-in.',
      'Push tokens (with your permission): if you allow notifications, we store a device push token so we can send alerts for social events, invites, and auto-publish confirmations.',
      'Safety and moderation: abuse reports you submit and block lists you maintain.',
      'Service data: standard diagnostics and error information needed to operate and secure the service (for example authentication events, API requests, and app version). We do not use third-party advertising or product-analytics SDKs, and we do not track you across other companies’ apps or websites.',

      'Sync sleep from Google Health when you explicitly connect that source in Settings.',
      'Show your posts to friends according to each post\'s privacy settings, and show friends\' posts to you.',
      'Operate social interactions: friend requests, comments, kudos, mentions, sleep buddy tag requests, club invites, challenge invitations, and friend / club / challenge invite links.',
      'Match hashed contact identifiers (when you grant Contacts access) so you can find friends already on Slumber, and so others can find you if you leave Findable by contacts on.',

    heading: 'Data protection',

      'We protect personal information and Google user data (including Google Health sleep data and OAuth credentials) with the following mechanisms:',
      'Encryption in transit: All client–server and server–Google API traffic uses HTTPS / TLS.',
      'Encryption at rest: Account data, sleep posts, and OAuth credentials are stored in our hosted database (Supabase / PostgreSQL), which encrypts data at rest.',
      'On-device offline drafts: Queued posts saved while offline live in app-protected storage on your device until sync; they are uploaded over HTTPS when connectivity returns. The app may also cache friend-visible content on device for a limited time so the feed still works after a restart.',
      'Credential isolation: Google Health OAuth refresh tokens are never stored on your device or exposed to the mobile/web client. Tokens are stored server-side and usable only by authenticated backend services (Edge Functions with a service role). Database row-level security and revoked client grants prevent anonymous or signed-in users from reading other users\' tokens or Google Health credentials.',
      'Least privilege: We request only the Google Health sleep read-only scope needed to sync sleep. We do not request write access to Google Health.',
      'Access control: Sleep and account data are scoped to your authenticated account. Friend-visible content is limited by mutual friendship and per-post privacy settings. Administrative access to production systems is limited to authorized operators and used for security, reliability, and abuse investigation.',
      'Deletion and revocation: Disconnecting Google Health clears the stored refresh token. Deleting your account removes your authentication record, personal sleep data, photos, health connections, contact hashes, and push tokens. You may also revoke Slumber in your Google Account security settings.',

      'We do not sell your personal information.',
      'Friends: Slumber uses mutual friend requests. Both people must accept before either can see the other\'s posts. Your feed shows posts from accepted friends and your own posts.',
      'Find from contacts (optional): hashes emails and phones on your device and checks whether matching Slumber accounts exist. Your address book is never uploaded. People who turn off Findable by contacts in Settings are excluded from matching.',
      'Post visibility: posts default to visible to friends. You can mark an individual post private (hidden from friends\' feeds; tagged sleep buddies can still open it). Offline drafts stay on your device only until they sync.',
      'Private nights and aggregates: marking a post private hides it from friends\' feeds and from Compare with friends. Wearable minutes from private nights can still count toward challenges, global and club leaderboards, and club analytics.',
      'Dream privacy: you can blur a dream entry so friends see that you logged a dream without reading the text. Mentioned friends may see a minimal indicator when they are @mentioned in a private dream.',
      'Personal records: all-time and 30-day PR chips on posts are on by default. You can hide best and/or worst PRs from friends in Settings. You still see your own.',
      'Sleep buddies: when you tag a friend on a post, they must accept before the tag appears to other viewers. Pending or accepted buddies can open a private post they were tagged on.',
      'Compare: you can put your wearable sleep next to selected friends (including from their profile, and on the website). Compare follows normal post visibility, so friends do not see your private nights there.',
      'Clubs: clubs are named groups independent of friendship. Joining a club does not unlock other members\' feed posts — you still need to be friends to see nights in the feed. Club analytics can aggregate accepted members\' wearable nights, including private posts, into averages and similar summaries. Last-night club analytics are available to members; longer ranges may be offered as Premium.',
      'Leaderboards: any signed-in user can see Social → Leaderboards (usernames and wearable averages). You are included by default. You can opt out in Settings → Privacy → Appear on leaderboards. Club leaderboards among accepted members are separate and are not controlled by that global opt-out. Blocked users are excluded.',
      'Challenges: participants in a challenge you join can see challenge-related sleep contributions according to challenge rules. Wearable nights, including private posts, can count toward challenge scoring.',
      'Invite links: you can share friend, club, and challenge links. Logged-out web pages may show a limited preview (for example a username, or a non-private post title and sleep date). Accepting a link creates the relevant relationship.',
      'Friend suggestions: if you have few friends, Slumber may suggest people who share mutual friends, including via @username.',
      'Web companion: when you sign in on the website, you can view the same friend-visible content your account can access in the app and interact with kudos and comments. The website does not sync Apple Health, Health Connect, or Google Health, does not log sleep, and does not run Find from contacts or auto-publish.',
      'Service providers: we use infrastructure providers to host and operate the service under contractual safeguards, including Supabase (authentication, database, and file storage), Expo and Apple/Google push services (notifications), Apple (HealthKit, Sign in with Apple, App Store), Google (sign-in, Google Health, Play, and push), and RevenueCat (subscription entitlements if you purchase Slumber Premium).',
